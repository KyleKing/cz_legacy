# cz_legacy

> [!NOTE]
> After using `commitizen` for a few years, the utility of `cz_legacy` for changelogs from years ago has become less valuable. [Based on public code](https://github.com/search?q=cz_legacy+language%3Atoml&type=code), this package doesn't appear to have use outside of my projects and therefore will be archived. If you have a use case for this project or questions, please feel free to submit an issue and tag me (@kyleking) here: https://github.com/KyleKing/calcipy
